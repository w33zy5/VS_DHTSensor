# VS DHTSensor
This is a simple visual studio windows form that can accept DHT sensor temperature and humidity from arduino uno device.

Projects is used to detect DHT Sensor temperature and humidity connected with arduino output then deliver it to Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community Windows Form. Temperature and Humidity detected from the arduino device will be projected in windows form and inputted to a line chart.
