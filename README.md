# VS DHTSensor
This is a simple visual studio windows form that can accept DHT sensor temperature and humidity from arduino uno device.

Projects is used to detect DHT Sensor temperature and humidity connected with arduino output then deliver it to Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community Windows Form. Temperature and Humidity detected from the arduino device will be projected in windows form and inputted to a line chart.

Device Used:
1. AM2302 DHT22 Temperature and Humidity sensor
2. Arduino Uno R3

Setting:
1. DHT22 sensor:
   * VCC to 5V
   * GND to GND GPIO
   * DAT to pin 4
